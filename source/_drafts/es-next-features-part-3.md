This is the last part of a series of posts, in which I took a look at JavaScript features still in the proposal stage and handpicked the 10 top features that I'm excited about most. [The first three features were Pipelines, Partial application and Decorators](/writing/upcoming-esnext-features-part-1/), then the [second post was about the Bind Operator, Top-level Await and Optional Chaining](/writing/upcoming-esnext-features-part-2/). In this last post I'll describe the last four:

- Private & static fields
- Realms
- Nullish Coalescing operator
- Throw expressions
